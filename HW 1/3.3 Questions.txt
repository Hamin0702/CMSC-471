1. Describe the heuristic function used in your A* search.
For my A* search, all the states have the heuristic value of 1.

2. Is the heuristic you used admissible? Describe why.
Yes, because the cost of each action is 1 so it will never overestimate if the heuristic values are 1.

3. For each of the 5 initial to goal state pair, did BFS, DFS and/or A* reach a solution? If not, describe why?
BFS did, 

4. For each of the 5 initial to goal state pair, is the BFS, DFS and/or A* solution optimal? Describe why.


5. How would you convert the A* search algorithm into Uniform Cost Search?
